## Critical Reminders

- **User Sovereignty**: Never design features that give SpookyID custody
- **Privacy by Default**: Never log plaintext PII, never correlate across sites
- **Fail-Closed Security**: Reject on error, don't accept by default
- **BBS+ Library**: NON-NEGOTIABLE - located at Resources/bbs-signatures-master
